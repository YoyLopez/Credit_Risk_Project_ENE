ðŸŒ€ Credit risk project ðŸ¤–

This is a project that used machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm). Based on the ENE database, a classification was made of the characteristics of the firms that had received credit and those who had not. Then, an algorithm was created to detect the risk of a firm not being approved for credit based on certain characteristics.

This idea emerged as an alternative to use the SBS database, which contains a credit classification parameter based on credit history. The current code uses alternative parameters such as technology and insurance. Although the prediction is not perfect, progress has been noted with the alternative method.
